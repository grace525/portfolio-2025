<p>
I'm Grace, a passionate global citizen with a love for adventure. My journey has taken me from being part of the Global Engineering RAP to studying abroad in Costa Rica, as well as volunteering with the SWAP program at CU, where I had the rewarding experience of tutoring English to an international student.
						<p>
I've also dedicated four seasons working with the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps (RMYC) on outdoor conservation projects, and I've shared my love for nature as a backpacking guide. These experiences have strengthened my resolve to protect our planet and inspire others to do the same.
						<p>
As a designer, I strive to create impactful solutions that make the world a better place. I believe in the power of thoughtful design to drive positive change and bring people together. Whether it's through innovative engineering or community-focused projects, I'm always eager to collaborate and contribute to a brighter, more sustainable future.
						<p>
Feel free to reach out – I’d love to connect and explore how we can make a difference together!
