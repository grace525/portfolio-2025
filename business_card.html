		<h1> Overview </h1>
		<p>
			<b>
				Software: Adobe Illustrator <br>
				Timeline: 2 weeks <br> <br>
			</b>

			This business card and car magnet were designed for a local Colorado yard care business looking to expand its client base. To increase visibility within the community, the client chose a car magnet as an effective way to advertise on the go. The business card makes it easy to share contact information and leave a lasting impression on potential clients.

		<h1> Design Precedents </h1>
				<div id="centerImages" >

		<p>
			These marketing materials from similar industries convey familiarity and trust through timeless design. Bold text and colors immediately grab attention and reinforce a sense of reliability. Navy, red, black, and gray create an industrial feel, while green and blue suggest freshness, environmentalism, and professionalism. Orange, on the other hand, is warm, inviting, and earthy while still making a bold statement. A common trend across these designs is the use of strong typography, often in all caps, paired with simple yet effective imagery—such as a water droplet for a plumber or a toolset for a handyman—to quickly communicate services at a glance. Gathering these design precedents helped me establish a clear vision for my own design approach. <br> <br>

		<h1> Ideation </h1>
				<div id="centerImages" >

		<p>
			 In this step, I determined what information belonged on the business card versus the car magnet and gathered key details like standard sizing, color profiles for printing, production costs, and design constraints. I learned that full-color printing is more expensive and that on-screen colors may differ from the final product, making test prints a worthwhile investment. <br> <br>

		</p>

				<h1> Preliminary Designs </h1>
				<div id="centerImages" >
			<img src="images/business_card/sketches.jpeg" alt="Website Screenshot" height="50%" width="auto">
			<img src="images/business_card/sketches2.jpeg" alt="Website Screenshot" height="50%" width="auto">
			<img src="images/business_card/prototypes.jpg" alt="Website Screenshot" height="50%" width="auto">
		</div>
		<p>
			 Next, I created quick, low-fidelity sketches to explore different layouts and color schemes. I printed several prototypes to test text legibility, compare designs to other business cards, and determine which felt most appealing. <br> <br>
			</p>


			<h1> Refining the final concept </h1>
			<div id="centerImages" >
		
				<img src="images/business_card/sketch.jpg" alt="Website Screenshot" height="50%" width="auto">
				<img src="images/business_card/arrow.png" alt="Website Screenshot" style="width: 50px; height: 50px; opacity: 50%;">
				<img src="images/business_card/vector.jpg" alt="Website Screenshot" height="50%" width="auto">
			</div>
			<p>
				Now I created a vector image from the chosen sketch to create the final draft. <br> <br>
			</p>



		<h1> Reflection </h1>

		<p> 

			This project reinforced the importance of balancing aesthetics with practicality in print design. Gathering design precedents helped establish a clear direction, while early sketches and prototypes ensured the final product was both visually appealing and functional. Reviewing the designs with the client allowed me to refine the details to better fit their vision, and finalizing the design as a vector ensured scalability and print quality. Overall, this process highlighted the value of testing, client feedback, and careful consideration of production constraints. <br><br>
